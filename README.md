# DangerousBusiness

A library mod for Lethal Company that provides interfaces into the game's code.

## Building
1. Clone the repository
2. Set environment variable `LETHAL_COMPANY` to the path of your Lethal Company installation
3. Use your IDE's build function to build the project, I have no clue how to do it from the command line :)
